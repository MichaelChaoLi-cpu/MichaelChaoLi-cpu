# Rules of Plan and Log Records
     
In order to manage the computing ability of the whole station, including Com-left, Com-right, and Super, we build the computing plan to record current status.    
   
## Status Window
The records always follow this style

## Log Relus   
From Octo 1st, 2022, every repo for research is required to add one markdown to records the basic ideas, including to download data, make data, wash data, basic ideas for analyses, codes for analyses, writing idea, visualiztion sample, visualization code, and other necessary records. For saveing the time to scan this file, we the records should be very easy to read.    
The sample of the records:    
*******************************    
Data: 2022.10.01     
Platform: Com-left, Com-right, or Super       
Records: (As short as possible, but no abbrevition for readibility)         
*******************************      
      
## Summary Relus       
Except README, Log, we also need to include Data Summary, Analysis Summary, and Writing Summary.   
     
## To sum up      
**README, Log, Data Summary, Analysis Summary, and Writing Summary** must be included in a published repo, from Octo 1st, 2022!
